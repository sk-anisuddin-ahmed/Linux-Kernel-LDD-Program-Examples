    help
      This is a simple character device driver that demonstrates
      basic kernel module programming concepts including:
      - Character device registration
      - File operations (open, read, write, release)
      - Device class and device creation
      - User-kernel space data transfer

      Say Y here to compile this driver into the kernel.
      Say M here to compile this driver as a loadable module.
      Say N here if you don't want this driver.

      To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
      module will be called char_device.

      If unsure, say M.
